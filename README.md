# Iris #

Improving the Quality of Care, one Metric at a Time.

| Build | Status | Code Quality | Test Coverage |

## Setup ##

<em>How do I, as a developer, start working on the project?</em>

Ruby version is specified in `.ruby-version`. Recent versions of rbenv will detect it automatically.

### Boxen ###
This project requires Dabo's development provisioning system, Boxen. Go [here](https://github.com/dabohealth/dabo-boxen) to setup Boxen.

After setting up Boxen, you can use boxen to clone and setup the `Iris` project automatically in `~/src/iris` by running:

    $ boxen iris

Boxen will:

* Ensure Postgresql is installed and running
* Install project version of Ruby and automatically run `bundle install`
* Prepare development and test databases as well as default config/database.yml
* Setup nginx/dnsmasq so you can access the development server at `http://iris.dev/`

### Starting the development server ###

1. `foreman start`
  * To start the web server only: `foreman start web`
  * To start the Sidekiq server only: `foreman start worker`

2. `open http://localhost:3000`
  * If using Boxen, you can access the development server with `open http://iris.dev/`


### Heroku ###
Heroku access is needed for loading realistic data from integration, staging, and production environments, as well as deploying to any of these environments.

1. Obtain `eng-service@dabohealth.com` Heroku credentials from Passpack.
2. Login from the command line: `heroku login`
3. Add the Heroku repos: `for x in integration staging production; do git remote add ${x} git@heroku.com:iris-${x}.git; done`

### Binaries and Binstubs ###
In Rails 4, binaries (`rails`, `rake`, `rspec`) now live in `bin/`. You no longer need to prefix these commands with `bundle exec`. Instead, add `bin` to your `PATH` environment variable:

    # ~/.profile
    export PATH=bin:$PATH

## Testing ##

Iris uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) for ruby tests and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for JavaScript tests.

- `rspec` will run all ruby specs.
- `rake jasmine` will start the Jasmine server. Point your browser to `localhost:8888` to run all javascript specs in the browser. The suite will run every time this page is re-loaded.

### Continuous Integration ###

Tests are run on each branch on GitHub via [Semaphore](https://semaphoreapp.com/)

Any branch that passes CI and has an open pull request will have a Heroku instance created modeled after `iris-acceptance`, available at `http://iris-acceptance-[pr_id].herokuapp.com`

### Browser Testing ###

Feature tests are run in Chrome via Selenium. The Semaphore CI platform also runs feature specs in Selenium Chrome.

## Deploying ##

Iris is deployed to Heroku. Semaphore will automatically deploy passing builds to the Heroku apps below:

| branch     | app | site |
| ---------- | --- | ---- |
| master     | [iris-integration](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/iris-integration/resources) | [iris-integration.herokuapp.com](https://iris-integration.herokuapp.com/) |
| staging    | [iris-staging](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/iris-staging/resources) | [iris-staging.herokuapp.com](https://iris-staging.herokuapp.com/) |
| production | [iris-production](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/iris-production/resources) | [iris.dabohealth.com](https://iris.dabohealth.com/) |
| feature branches | iris-acceptance-[your-pr-id] | e.g [iris-acceptance-1234567](https://iris-acceptance-1234567.herokuapp.com)

* **Integration** has all the code that will be included in the next release. It is where code is merged to Master. Continuous Integration tests must pass before deployment. Data is refreshed as needed.

* **Staging** is used as a production deploy test, or *production practice*. Data is always refreshed before deployment.

* **Production** is the only place where users (Dabo staff or customers) access our systems.

Integration and Staging applications use sanitized data from production (real metric samples and other data, but all personal information scrubbed).

### Acceptance/Feature Apps ###

Temporary "acceptance" apps are created upon opening a pull request for a feature branch. After the feature has been accepted and the code merged into master, the acceptance app is automatically spun down.

### Deployment Schedule ###
Continuous deployment of bug fixes and performance improvements take place Mondayâ€“Thursday (never Friday or weekends/holidays). For every production release, an engineer is responsible for deployment and will be on-call until the next release. Additionally, the on-call engineer from the previous deployment will serve as backup on-call.

A feature flipping gem (TBD) manages feature deployment. Features can be enabled at a certain time and for certain clients.

### Database Backups ###

Heroku provides scheduled database backups. For a list of available backups for that Heroku environment, run:

    heroku pgbackups -a iris-[integration|staging|production]

See [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pgbackups) for details.

### Error reporting ###

Errors are sent to [Airbrake](https://dabo.airbrake.io).

### Analytics ###

- TBD

### Performance monitoring ###

New Relic is included in the project in development and via Heroku environments. To see metrics on recent requests in **development** run:

* `open http://localhost:3000/newrelic`

* If using **Boxen**, `open http://iris.dev/newrelic`

In integration/production, use the Heroku web resource link to browse to the New Relic dashboard for the app.

### Environment variables ###

Treat `.env` like a schema for environment keys. Those needed to run the app in development mode should be set already. Blank entries are not needed in development mode but are used in at least one of the production environments (where they are set via `heroku config`).

## Code style and quality ##

### Javascript ###

- TBD

### Ruby ###
[Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) is configured in `.rubocop.yml` to enforce code quality and style standards based on the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) and runs every time you commit using a pre-commit hook.

To identify and have Rubocop automatically correct violations when possible, run:

* `rubocop -a [path_to_file]` for individual files
* `rubocop -a` for all Ruby files
